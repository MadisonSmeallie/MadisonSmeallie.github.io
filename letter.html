    <p>
        <strong>Artistic Inspirations</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:
        <p>
            Impressionism
                <p>
                    Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.
                </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Abstract Expressionism
                <p>
                    This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.
                </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pop Art
                <p>
                    A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.
                </p>
